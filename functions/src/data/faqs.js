    "Question": `Q.What is the difference between the words “Islam, ” “Islamic, ” “Muslim, ” and “Arab”?`
    ,
    "Answer": `Islam is the name of a religion, as
    Christianity and Judaism are names of religions.The Arabic word “Islam” is based on the root “slm, ” which means peace
    or surrender to God.Combining both translations results in the combined meaning “the state of peace through following
    God’s guidance.” Islamic is an adjective that modifies a non - human noun, as for example, “Islamic art, ” “Islamic architecture, ”
“Islamic beliefs, ” etc.This term should not be used to refer to a person.A follower of Islam is called a Muslim, or
“one who is in a state of peace by following God’s guidance.” While the term Arab has been used in the past to refer
to members of a Semitic ethnic group from the Arabian Peninsula, today the word “Arab” refers to people from Arabic - speaking
countries, most of which are in the Middle East and North Africa.The term Arabian was historically used to describe
an inhabitant of the Arabian Peninsula.Today “Arabian” is used as an adjective to describe a non - human noun(e.g., Arabian
    coffee); it should not be used to refer to people.The following questions about basic Muslim beliefs(2 through 12)
are answered in accord with the scholars mentioned above, reflecting majority Sunni views.`

{
    "Question": `What does Islam teach ?`,
    "Answer": `Islam’s primary message, as understood by the overwhelming majority of Muslims, is the continuation
of the Abrahamic monotheistic tradition’s belief in one God.The three major dimensions of Islam include beliefs, ritual
practices, and the effort to improve one’s character and actions.There are six major beliefs in Islam and five central
practices that are referred to as the Five Pillars.The last dimension of Islam focuses on the cultivation of excellent
moral character to better oneself and the world around oneself.It teaches a set of values that promote life, liberty,
    equality and justice.Some of these values include:

Respect for the earth and all creatures
Care and compassion for those less fortunate        
The importance of seeking knowledge
Honesty and truthfulness in word and deed
Striving continuously to improve oneself and the world

    "Question": `

Q.How do Muslims practice their faith ?


    `, "Answer": `


    Muslims practice their faith in many different ways, but the major practices for
    both Sunni and Shi’a Muslims are known as the Five Pillars, which include:




the profession of faith, namely that there is only one God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God;


the five daily prayers;
required annual donation to charity in the amount of 2.5 % of one’s excess wealth;


fasting during daylight hours in the month of Ramadan; and

making a pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime, if one is mentally, physically, and financially able to do so.


`},
{
    "Question": `

Q.What are the foundational sources of Islamic beliefs and practices ?

    `, "Answer": ` 
    The primary sources of knowledge about Islam are the
Qur’an, which Muslims generally believe is the divinely revealed word of God, and the Sunnah, which refers to the example
or precedent of the Prophet Muhammad(i.e., what he said, did, approved, disapproved, caused, ordered, or allowed to
    happen).Much of what is known about the Sunnah is from the collection of sayings or reports known as hadith, or prophetic
tradition.The hadith describe actions of the Prophet Muhammad or actions that his companions attributed to his teachings.
Hadith also elaborate and provide context to the Qur’an.For Shi’as, in addition to the aforementioned, the rulings of
the twelve Imams are considered a primary source.Other sources may exist for different Muslim sects.In addition to
these primary sources, Muslims have also traditionally relied on the following: scholarly consensus, that is, the agreement
of knowledgeable scholars upon a particular issue; and analogical reasoning, which means applying principles or laws
derived from the Qur’an and Sunnah to similar situations not explicitly addressed by them.The lived experience of Islam,
    which naturally varies widely not only in different cultures but also with different individuals, also impacts and determines
a Muslim’s understanding and practice of Islam.

{
    "Question": `

Q.Why do some people suffer so much in this life, especially the innocent, such as children?

`, "Answer": `


This is a challenging issue
for all religions that proclaim a belief in a God who is at once omnipotent and beneficent.We believe that God tries
people in different ways, through both hardship and ease.While the cause of suffering is not always evident, the way
that people respond to difficulty is a test of their moral fiber.Responding to hardship with patience and fortitude
is a virtue for which we believe a great reward is promised in this life and the afterlife.Additionally, there may be
a silver lining behind every difficulty.For instance, major disasters often bring out the best in people, inspiring
them to perform remarkable acts as they respond to their own or another’s hardship with compassion and courage and come
to the aid of those in need.Muslims also take comfort in their belief that life doesn’t end after death.

    "Question": `

Q.God’s love for humanity is a central theme in many religions.Are there similar teachings in Islam ?

    `, "Answer": `
We believe that God’s
love for humanity is indeed central to our faith.The Qur’an mentions God’s compassion and mercy 192 times, as opposed
to God’s wrath, which is mentioned only 17 times.Two of God’s main attributes are the “Compassionate” and the “Merciful.”
Both of these names denote God’s love and care for all creation.These are the two most often mentioned names of God,
    since all but one of the 114 chapters in the Qur’an begin with “In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.”
The Qur’an cites 99 different names or attributes of God, many of which also emphasize these characteristics, including
“the Loving, ” “the Giving, ” “the Forgiving, ” and “the Kind.”

{
    "Question": `

What do Muslims believe about angels ?

    `, "Answer": `humans, angels are described as not possessing free will but as being by nature assigned to specific duties.Two of the
most prominent angels mentioned by name in the Qur’an are Gabriel(Jibril) and Michael(Mikhail).Gabriel is the angel
of revelation and Michael is the angel of compassion.
    `},

{
    "Question": `

What does Islam say about Satan ?

    `, "Answer": `humans and angels, known as a “jinn.” Humans are said to have been made from clay, angels from light, and jinn from fire.
While the Qur’an teaches that some jinn are good and submit to God, it states that others, such as Iblis or Shaytan(Satan),            try to tempt people to do evil, as in the belief about Satan in traditional Christian theology.`},

{
    "Question": `

How do the stories of the prophets in Islam compare with those in Christianity and Judaism ?

    `, "Answer": `    we are talking about.In many cases, the stories of the prophets in the Qur’an are similar to the stories that are in
    the Bible.Some examples include:


the story of Noah and his ark;

the story of Abraham and Sarah and the birth of their son Isaac, who is also considered a prophet;

the story of Jacob and his twelve sons, including Joseph, who is also considered a prophet; and

the most oft - mentioned prophet in the Qur’an, Moses, and the story of his mission in Egypt to rescue his people.


Some of the major differences between the biblical account of some of these prophets and the Qur’an stem from the fact that
the Qur’an holds that all prophets were immune from major sins.The stories of Prophet Jesus are close to the Bible in
    their descriptions of his virginal birth and miracles but differ sharply in their account of the divinity of Jesus and
crucifixion; the Qur’an states that Jesus was only a man, not divine, and that before the crucifixion Jesus was taken
into heaven and replaced by a person who looked like him.    `},

{
    "Question": `
Were there female prophets ?
    `, "Answer": `
Some Muslim scholars hold the view that there were female prophets.Three of the women regarded
by these scholars as prophets are Eve, the wife of Adam, Asiyah, the wife of Pharaoh(who in the Quran is the one who
adopts Moses as her son, as opposed to the daughter who does so in the Bible), and Mary the mother of Jesus, because
they all received revelation from God.Whether one takes the position that they were prophets who brought a specific
message to their people or not, Muslims revere them as three among the many righteous and saintly women mentioned in
    the Qur’an.

{
    "Question": `

Q.Why do Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad is the final prophet ?
    `, "Answer": `
The majority of Muslims believe that the Prophet
Muhammad is the final prophet on the grounds that the Qur’an and hadith state so.


`},

{
    "Question": `
Q.Why can’t you display images of the Prophet Muhammad ?

    `, "Answer": `
There is no specific teaching in traditional Islamic sources forbidding
images of the Prophet Muhammad, and in fact one can find representations of Muhammad and other prophets in different
periods of Islamic history.What scholars warn against is the worship of such images, which in more recent times has
led some groups to promote the idea that it is forbidden to represent the Prophet Muhammad.


`},

{
    "Question": `
Q.Why did some Muslims respond with protest and violence against portrayals of Muhammad in cartoons and film ?

    `, "Answer": `


This question
refers to protests, sometimes erupting into lethal violence, as in the recent attack in Paris, against cartoons published
    in a French satirical weekly and against the film < em > The Innocence of Muslims</em >
.These protests raise the question of freedom of expression, and the instances of violence clearly violated the principle
of respect for life.The great majority of American Muslims and many Muslims elsewhere affirm freedom of expression even
for material that is offensive.Muslim leaders and organizations worldwide, even in countries that restrict the publication
of such offensive material, vigorously condemned the instances of violence.Violent reaction to these images was almost
certainly fueled by political issues rather than purely by anger at the offensive images.Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf
insisted that the Benghazi attack, claimed to be a spontaneous response to caricatures of Muhammad published in Denmark,
    was in fact long planned by militants, while the Paris atrocities were the work of militants who may well have been striving
to recruit French Muslims to al - Qaeda by creating an incident that would isolate them from other French people.In either
case, the images served only as a pretext.`},

    "Question": `

Q.Jesus was a non - violent reformer while Muhammad fought in wars.Why is there a difference between Jesus and Muhammad
    in terms of their approach ?
`, "Answer": `
    reformer.” This is not the case, just as it is not the case with Muhammad, who has been and is seen in many different
ways by Muslims.In his book
    < em >


    Jesus through the Centuries

, church historian Jaroslav Pelikan depicts and analyzes the varied views of Jesus at different times and in different cultures.
He devotes a whole chapter to Jesus as both “Prince of Peace” and instigator of divine warfare—sometimes at one and the
same time.The representations of Muhammad are likewise multiple.In her book
    < em >


    The Lives of Muhammad

, Kecia Ali writes “Far from being uniform or non - changing, both non - Muslim and Muslim views of Muhammad have been diverse,    multifaceted, and subject to dramatic changes over the centuries.” Even when one considers Jesus and Muhammad as historical
figures, it is important to keep in mind a significant difference between their positions.Jesus founded a community
of believers that was politically powerless and had to function in the shadow of the overwhelming power of the Roman
Empire.Muhammad, on the other hand, eventually found himself at the head of a new political community in Medina and
was therefore called upon to function as a political and even military leader.Whatever differences one may find between
Muhammad and Jesus should not obscure the fact that, in our vision of Islam, both Christianity and Islam uphold the principle
of respect for life.

{
    "Question": `Q.Why did the Prophet Muhammad marry so many women ?

    `, "Answer": `Polygamy was common in 7th - century Arabia, as it has been in many other
cultures, especially for a political leader; for instance, the patriarchs in the Hebrew Bible are shown as having multiple
wives, and the kings of Israel are described as having harems numbering in some cases into the hundreds.According to
Muslim historians, the Prophet Muhammad’s marriages were contracted to assist needy widows and divorcees and to solidify
the community of Muslims by forging alliances among the tribes in and around Medina.In light of the time and place,
    there was nothing unique or unusual about Muhammad marrying several women.

    "Question": `
Q.Why did the Prophet Muhammad marry a nine - year old ? If she was not nine, how old was she ?

    `, "Answer": `The actual age of Aisha at the time of her marriage to Muhammad is disputed, but, the marriage could not have been consummated until she reached puberty.In many cultures, women are or were married years before a marriage is consummated.The custom of early betrothal and marriage continued until the late 19th and early 20th century in much of the world, including Europe and North America, where there are still many states that allow for underage marriage.`

{
    "Question": `
Q.What do Muslims believe about Jesus ?

    `, "Answer": `


Muslims overwhelmingly revere Jesus and believe that he was born to the Virgin Mary
through an act of God, just as Adam is believed to have been created by God without a father or mother.The Qur’an describes
his conception and birth, as well as his many miracles such as healings of the sick.The Qur’an also emphasizes that
Jesus was a great prophet of God, as well as a messenger who received revelation from God, but that he was, like all
other prophets, only a human being.

`},
{
    "Question": `
Q.Why does the Qur’an talk about Jesus more often than Muhammad ?

    `, "Answer": `
Most of the Qur’an depicts itself as a text addressed
to Muhammad; it therefore talks less about Muhammad than it does to Muhammad about other subjects, including previous
prophets such as Jesus.

`},

{
    "Question": `
Q.What do Muslims believe about Mary ?

    `, "Answer": `

Muslims generally believe that she is the Virgin Mother of the Prophet Jesus.An
entire chapter in the Qur’an is named after her.The chapter called Mary(Maryam in Arabic) and other verses in the Qur’an
emphasize her piety, righteousness, and status as an exemplar for all people, male and female.The Qur’an describes her
as the greatest of all women: “God chose and preferred her above all the women of the worlds.” (Qur’an, 3: 42)



`},

{
    "Question": `
Q.Why is it that Muslims do not celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas ?

    `, "Answer": `

While Muslims greatly revere Jesus, Christmas
is generally considered a Christian holiday and not a part of Muslim cultures except where there are Christian minorities.
There is even debate among Muslims over the celebration of Muhammad’s birthday.However, some Muslims celebrate Christmas
as part of an American cultural observance like Thanksgiving or Independence Day.

`},
{
    "Question": `
Q.Is the Qur’an read only in Arabic ?

    `, "Answer": `

Since only 20 % of all Muslims are Arabs, the Qur’an has been translated into and is
read in many other languages, with multiple English translations.However, because Muslims consider the original Arabic
text to be the literal word of God, during ritual prayers, the Qur’an is recited in its original Arabic language(just
    as some Catholic churches still perform mass in Latin or synagogues perform part of their prayer in Hebrew).In order
to fully comprehend the Qur’an for instruction and spiritual enrichment, non - Arab Muslims also read the translation in
    their native language.

`},
{
    "Question": `
Q.What are the different kinds of prayer that Muslims practice ?

    `, "Answer": `
Prayer among Muslims can take many forms.Three very common forms are Salat(ritual prayer), Dhikr(remembrance of God, which usually involves the repetition of God’s names), and Du’a(supplication, or asking God for a need or desire or for forgiveness).
